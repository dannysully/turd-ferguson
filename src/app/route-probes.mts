/**
 * The probes that read which routes are open and which are shut.
 *
 * Not a test, deliberately. Three suites need these - `route-closure`
 * (is a private route shut), `sitemap` (does a listed URL contradict
 * robots.txt) and `public-routes` (is a page meant to be found still findable)
 * - and **importing a test module registers its tests**, so the importer runs
 * the imported suite a second time under its own name.
 *
 * The answer that was reached for first was to re-state the parser in each
 * file, and `route-closure.test.mts` carried a comment saying so. That is the
 * duplication this repo keeps finding the hard way: `disallowedPaths` was
 * written twice, identically, with nothing reconciling the two, so a fix to
 * one would silently leave the other reading a different robots.txt. Same
 * shape as `SCAN_FROM_EMAIL` on four senders and one list.
 *
 * A plain `.mts` module is importable by every suite, runs nothing on import,
 * and has one definition. `dynamic-render.mts` is already this.
