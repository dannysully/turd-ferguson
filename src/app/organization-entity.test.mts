/**
 * What the entity says about itself, which is a different question from
 * whether it resolves.
 *
 * `structured-data.test.mts` reads the same blocks and asks four things of
 * them: do they parse, does every `@id` resolve, does every FAQ answer match
 * the page, is every own-domain URL a real route. All four are questions about
 * *what is there*. Not one of them can notice a property that is absent, and
 * the whole reason this site declares an Organization at all is to be the
 * entity an answer engine resolves a brand against - which is a question about
 * what the node *contains*.
 *
 * That gap had a live instance, found on 20 Sep 2026. `config/schema.ts`
 * listed `logo` under "deliberately absent" with the reason "There is no logo
 * file. The wordmark is drawn in markup by `BrandMark`, and the Open Graph
 * card is a share image rather than a logo." The second sentence is true and
 * the first is false: `src/app/icon.svg` is the brand mark as a square SVG,
 * Next serves it at `/icon.svg`, every built head links it, and
 * `structured-data.test.mts` names that very file in its own comment while
 * listing "every image on this site". Two files in one tree, one saying the
 * logo file does not exist and one naming it. Read from production the same
 * day: `/icon.svg` 200, 597 bytes; `/favicon.ico` 200, 19,515 - the bytes on
 * disk in both cases.
 *
 * Same species as the date formatter and the honeypot, arriving from a new
 * direction: there it was two copies of a function and the untested one was
 * wrong, here it is two statements about the tree and the untested one was
 * wrong. **A stated reason for an absence is a claim about the tree, and this
 * repo checks claims.** So the absences that remain carry a `holds` that
 * re-earns them, in the shape `spend-gates.test.mts` established, rather than
 * a sentence nothing executes.
 *
 * What this cannot see, plainly: whether any engine reads the logo, renders it
 * or ignores it. That is a statement about a vendor, vendor docs are
 * unreachable from this session, and nothing here claims one.
