/**
 * The Cited pages page names no price, no marketplace, no difficulty, no DR
 * and no "you could place this" (R144, 1 Oct 2026; BRIEF-4 P4). It lists
 * other people's pages beside how often the engines cite them; a price or a
 * DR beside that list turns a reading into a quote for a placement nobody
 * has offered.
 *
 * Read: the source of the page and its component, comments stripped - every
 * word the page's own column can draw is a literal in one of these two
 * files, and the rest is the client's prompts and the cited hosts and paths.
 * Not the captured HTML: `npm run capture` runs without TRACKING_FIXTURE, so
 * every `/app/example/*` state it renders is the login page, and a sweep of
 * it would pass over nothing. Not the sidebar either: its T11 pack line
 * ("Add 5 clusters for $49 a month") names a price in nomada mode, and
 * upgrade prompts stay where T11 put them, by the brief.
 *
 * Floor: the component's heading and its five column heads, so a file that
 * moves or empties fails here instead of reading clean.
