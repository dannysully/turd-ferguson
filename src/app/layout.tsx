/**
 * The brand face, self-hosted through next/font rather than the fontsource
 * CSS import it replaces.
 *
 * The import only reached the browser through the app CSS chunk, so the
 * discovery chain was HTML -> CSS -> parse -> woff2, with no preload at any
 * step: the font started downloading after the stylesheet had been read.
 * With font-display: swap that means every cold visit paints in system-ui
 * and reflows when the real face lands - on all 21 pages.
 *
 * next/font emits a preload link for the subset named here, so the woff2 is
 * requested from the HTML instead of after the CSS, and adjustFontFallback
 * (on by default) writes a size-adjust fallback matched to Hanken's metrics,
 * so the swap no longer moves the line boxes.
 *
 * `subsets` names what gets preloaded, not what gets declared: the build
 * still emits all four @font-face blocks - cyrillic-ext, latin-ext,
 * vietnamese and latin - each gated by unicode-range exactly as fontsource
 * had them. So font bytes over the wire are unchanged; a British page
 * fetched only the latin file before and still does. What is new is the
 * preload and the fallback metrics, not a smaller download.
 *
 * This file owns the only <html> in the tree - there is no global-error.tsx -
 * so --font-hanken is always defined where globals.css reads it.
