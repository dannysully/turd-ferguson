/**
 * The description an answer engine reads, joined to one the site publishes.
 *
 * `config/posts.ts` exists so that the index, the post header and the
 * structured data cannot drift apart, and it says so in its own first line. It
 * got there for `headline`, for `url` and for `datePublished` - each of which
 * had been retyped, and each of which is now derived from the registry. It
 * stopped one field short. `blogPostingSchema` took `description: string`, a
 * loose argument joined to nothing, so every post typed a description a second
 * time by hand beside its SERP one and its share one.
 *
 * **What the second typing had already cost, read off the shipped prerenders
 * on 20 Sep 2026 rather than reasoned about:** two of the three posts had
 * copied their *share* line into the node and the third had copied its *SERP*
 * line. Three posts, one field, two different answers to what that field is a
 * copy of - and nothing anywhere could say so, because a hand copy references
 * nothing. Rewrite either line on any post and the node keeps the old sentence
 * in silence, on the one surface this product is about.
 *
 * The finding came in through `docs/prose-claims.mjs`, and it is that census's
 * own shape: `posts.ts` carried the sentence "nothing else on the site holds a
 * second copy of either", offered as the reason the descriptions did not
 * belong in the registry. It was false for all three posts. **The false
 * universal was not inert prose - it was the premise that kept the third
 * surface out of the file whose whole job is to hold the other two.**
 *
 * Which of the two it now reads is a judgement and is recorded in
 * `blogPostingSchema`: the SERP line, because schema `description` and a meta
 * description answer the same question and the share line is a hook.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Why this is scoped to `BlogPosting` and not to every writing node.** The
 * three `Article` nodes on this site deliberately carry their own authored
 * sentence - checked, not assumed, and the check is rule 2 below. Widening the
 * rule to `WRITING` would fail on a clean tree, and a rule that fails on a
 * clean tree is one that gets an exemption written for it.

/**
 * Rule 3, and it is this file's own refill.
 *

 * that the two copies AGREE, not that there is one source.** A page can hand
 * `postMetadata` one object literal and `blogPostingSchema` another, and as
 * long as somebody types the same sentence into both, rule 1 passes.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical costume. It is the exact state two of the three
 * posts were in before this push: the share line typed twice, byte for byte,
 * *agreeing* - and agreeing is what made it invisible for as long as it was.
 * A value rule fires the day a copy drifts; this one refuses the copy, which
 * is a push earlier.
 *
 * So: both calls on a post page must be passed the same identifier. An object
 * literal at either call site is a second place to type a description, and the
 * type on `blogPostingSchema` cannot tell the difference - `PostCopy` is
 * structural, and `{ description: "...", ogDescription: "..." }` satisfies it
 * perfectly.
 *
 * Comments are stripped first. `code()` carries the roll of the times that cut
 * has paid, and it applies to the file being written as much as to any other -
 * a doc comment here quoting `blogPostingSchema(post, COPY)` would otherwise
 * answer this rule on behalf of a page that had stopped doing it.
