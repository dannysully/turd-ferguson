/**
 * The four deadlines a scan runs against, and the order they have to be in.
 *
 * A pass is bounded four times over, by four numbers that live in four files
 * and are joined by nothing:
 *
 * | rung | where | what happens |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `SLOW_MS` | `ScanFlow.tsx` | the screen says "this one is taking a while" |
 * | `RUN_TIMEOUT_MS` | `pipeline.ts` | the pass gives up and writes `failed` |
 * | `maxDuration` | five route files | the platform kills the invocation |
 * | `STALL_AFTER_MS` | `stall.ts` | the reaper declares the row dead |
 * | `STUCK_MS` | `ScanFlow.tsx` | the screen stops polling |
 *
 * Every one of those files states the ordering in prose, and **not one of them
 * could tell you if it stopped being true**. `pipeline.ts` opens with "Every
 * route that starts a pass declares maxDuration = 300, so the platform stops
 * the invocation at five minutes too". `stall.ts` says the same sentence
 * again. `ScanFlow.tsx` says it a third time. The word `maxDuration` appeared
 * in no test in this repo before this file.
 *
 * ## Why prose is not enough here
 *
 * The ordering is not decoration - each rung exists because the one below it
 * is not enough, and inverting any adjacent pair is silent.
 *
 * Put `maxDuration` below `RUN_TIMEOUT_MS` and the pipeline's own ceiling can
 * never fire: the platform kills the function mid-read first, the catch that
 * writes `status = 'failed'` never runs, and the scan sits at `running` with a
 * step it will never leave. `pipeline.ts` describes exactly that failure, in
 * the past tense, as the reason the number is what it is. Nothing stops it
 * coming back. Two routes in this tree declare `maxDuration = 60` today and
 * both are correct - neither starts a pass - but they are one `after(() =>
 * runScan(id))` away from being the bug, and that edit moves no test, passes
 * `tsc`, passes the build and deploys.
 *
 * Put `STALL_AFTER_MS` below `maxDuration` and the reaper marks a pass failed
 * while it is still running and still spending, then the pass writes its
 * result on top - so a scan reports as failed and billed, or as complete after
 * being reaped, depending on which write lands last.
 *
 * Put `STUCK_MS` below `STALL_AFTER_MS` and the progress screen gives up
 * before the reaper has written anything, so the visitor is told the scan is
 * stuck while the row still says `running` and the retry they are offered
 * races the pass that is still going.
 *
 * None of those produces an error anywhere. They produce a wrong report, a
 * double spend, or a spinner with no end - which is the silent-failure species
 * this repo keeps paying for.
 *
 * ## The denominator, and why it is a call graph rather than a list
 *
 * "Every route that starts a pass" cannot be a list of filenames here, and the
 * reason is the finding. **Two of the five reach the pipeline indirectly.**
 * `/api/scan/[token]/unlock` and `/api/verify/[vtoken]` never mention
 * `runScan` or `runGatedScan`; they call `completeUnlock`, which runs the
 * gated pass in an `after()` of its own. A sweep grepping routes for the
 * pipeline's entry points would have found three of five, reported the tree
 * clean, and been blind to the two doors that start **the most expensive pass
 * this system runs** - the one an email address was traded for.
 *
 * So the set is a fixpoint over calls, not a list, and it is seeded from the
 * mechanism rather than from a name: a **pass entry point** is an exported
 * function in `pipeline.ts` whose body opens a deadline from the run-timeout
 * constant. That is the definition that makes the rung matter - a function
 * that installs the 270s deadline is exactly a function that needs the
 * platform to allow more than 270s. A third pass added tomorrow joins this
 * sweep with no edit here.
 *
 * Imports are stripped before any call is looked for, because an import is not
 * a call - the mistake `spend-gates` made when its import-graph draft read
 * `/full` and `/opportunities` as spenders. Comments are stripped for the
 * reason `source-read.mts` records nine times over: `scan/[token]/page.tsx`
 * names `completeUnlock` in prose and calls nothing.
 *
 * ## What this cannot see, said rather than implied
 *
 * - **Whether Vercel honours `maxDuration = 300`.** That is a statement about
 *   a vendor on a plan this session cannot read, and no source in this repo
 *   settles it. What is checked is that the repo is internally consistent:
 *   the number the pipeline reasons against is the number the routes declare.
 * - **Whether a pass started from somewhere that is not a route is bounded at
 *   all.** This paragraph said, until the question was asked of this file the
 *   minute after it went green, that a `"use server"` action calling `runScan`
 *   "would fail the third rule rather than being silently skipped". That was
 *   false, and it is the species this whole file is about: a stated reason for
 *   a safety property is a claim about the tree. An action is not a route, so
 *   it lands outside `PASS_ROUTES` and **every rule below would have passed
 *   over it** - the same hole, one indirection further out, that put two mail
 *   doors in nobody's list until `mail-doors.test.mts`. A server action has no
 *   `maxDuration` of its own; it runs under the segment that invoked it, and
 *   no page in this tree declares one. So the closure's non-route members are
 *   a recorded set with a reason each, and a new one fails.
 * - **Whether 270s is long enough for a real pass.** That is a measurement
 *   against live vendors, not a property of the tree.
 *
 * Nothing here retypes a duration. Every number is read out of the file that
 * declares it, which is the whole point - a test carrying its own copy of
 * `300` would agree with itself for ever while the tree moved underneath it,
 * and that is the blind-tripwire species this queue keeps finding.
