/**
 * Which routes in this tree can cause somebody to be billed.
 *
 * Not a test - `npm run check` globs `src/**\/*.test.mts`, so this is a helper
 * the way `src/app/dynamic-render.mts` and `src/lib/source-read.mts` are. It
 * exists because **two sweeps in this one directory were answering the same
 * question with two different denominators, and the smaller one did not know
 * it was smaller.**
 *
 * `spend-gates.test.mts` asks what stands in front of each spending door.
 * `paid-get.test.mts` asks whether a spending route answers GET - a real
 * question, because `robots.txt` closes `/scan/` and not `/scan?domain=...`,
 * so a GET that spends is every crawler on the internet spending a scan.
 * Different questions, one denominator, and it was written twice.
 *
 * ## What each copy could not see, measured 20 September 2026
 *
 * `paid-get` derived its set from the two *guard* names - a route was paid if
 * it called `checkCeilings` or `completeUnlock`. That is deriving off the
 * wrong thing: it names what stands in front of spend rather than what
 * spends, so **the three routes bounded by something else were invisible**.
 * One of them is `scan/[token]/confirm`, which runs the entire free pass -
 * every question against every engine - and is bounded by a compare-and-swap
 * instead of a ceiling. 5 of 8. Its own header called the set "DERIVED, not
 * typed here", and it was, off a premise that had quietly stopped being true.
 *
 * `spend-gates` typed its vendor list and called them "the two clients that
 * actually put a request on the wire to a vendor". There are three: **Resend
 * bills per message**, which is the premise `mail-doors.test.mts` is built on.
 * So `scan/[token]/resend` - under `src/app/api`, named `route.ts`, squarely
 * inside that walk, and existing only to put a second message on a vendor's
 * bill - was in neither of its lists. 7 of 8.
 *
 * Neither gap was reachable by editing either file's lists, which is the
 * argument for this one existing rather than for a third list.
 *
 * ## Nothing here is typed that can be walked
 *
 * `PAID` is five function names and every one is re-checked against the module
 * that exports it, so a rename fails loudly rather than emptying the set - the
 * failure mode a name-matching probe has by default. The mail senders are
 * walked for, not named. The routes are walked for, not named.
 *
 * ## The honest limit
 *
 * A route "spends" if its own source calls one of the paid entry points, or
 * imports a vendor client or a mail sender directly. That cannot see a paid
 * call reached through a module the route imports for another reason - which
 * is why the import-graph version of this was discarded: it reported `/full`
 * and `/opportunities` as spenders because something in their graph imports
 * `anthropic.ts`, when both only read rows that were already paid for. **An
 * import is not a call.** The named-entry-point list is narrower and true, and
 * the direct-import half is what stops a route routing around it.

 * 2. **A relative import of a vendor was invisible.** Nothing in `src/app/api`
 *    imports relatively today - measured, not assumed - but this tree has a
 *    standing rule that two modules import relatively on purpose and must not
 *    be tidied back to `@/`, so the idiom is live here. `importsModule` keys
 *    on the last two path segments, which survive any number of `../`.

 * Both were one line, both were invisible to every assertion over the set, and
