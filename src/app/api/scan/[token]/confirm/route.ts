   * minutes as well, because the page renders the column verbatim.

   * `isFreePassDead` is only true past the platform's own 300s ceiling, so
   * there is no live pass to race: nothing can move that row any more. The reap
   * is a compare-and-swap of its own and scoped to this scan, and once it lands
   * the status is `failed`, which the guard and the swap below both already
   * accept. Nothing else in this route changes.
