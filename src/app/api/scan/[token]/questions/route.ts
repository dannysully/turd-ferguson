/**
 * The questions, written but not yet asked.
 *
 * The confirm screen shows what is about to run before a penny is spent, which
 * is the whole point of that screen: if the category is wrong then every
 * question built on it is wrong, and nobody says so unless they are shown.
 *
 * Since 30 Sep 2026 (BRIEF-3 C1) it is not free: before the questions are
 * written it picks the scan's one cluster keyword - a model call for
 * candidates, then one DataForSEO volume read and one intent read, a few
 * cents, billed onto the scan's dfs_cost (which daily_cost_cap_usd sums) and
 * stored on the scan. A rewrite on the same topic and market reuses it. It
 * touches no engine and stores no questions - what gets asked is what comes
 * back through /confirm, after the visitor has pruned it.
 */

/**
 * How many times one scan may have its question set written.
 *
 * The first set plus four rewrites. The route is otherwise unbounded - nothing
 * else stops the same token asking for a new set forever - and an Anthropic
 * call is not covered by daily_cost_cap_usd, which sums DataForSEO spend only.
 *
 * Counted off preview_calls, which exists because this used to count off
 * anthropic_calls and that column stopped meaning previews the day the
 * pipeline started billing onto it. A free pass writes one call for the
 * question set, one per engine for brand extraction, one to judge the
 * leaderboard and one for source kinds, so any scan that has run is past a
 * ceiling of six before a visitor has rewritten anything. Where that showed
 * was the retry a failed scan offers: the screen came back, asked for its
 * preview, and was told we had rewritten these a few times now.
 *
 * Both columns are still written. anthropic_calls is the cost, which the
 * admin page reads; preview_calls is the allowance.
 *
 * Taken as a reservation before the call goes out rather than counted after it
 * comes back. Read-then-write let every request in a concurrent batch read the
 * same number, pass, spend, and write the same total - so a hundred requests
 * were a hundred calls and moved the column by one. The route is public and
 * its only credential is the scan token, so a batch is a thing anyone holding
 * a link can send. note_preview_call does it in one statement instead.
