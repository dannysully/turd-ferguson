  // matched every condition this cache tests. A visitor typing a domain
  // somebody had benchmarked would have been handed that reading as their free
  // scan: the campaign's five fixed questions instead of the fourteen this
  // product generates, against the campaign's topic rather than theirs, and
  // titled with somebody else's brief. Nothing would have failed, and the cache
  // would have made it instant.
