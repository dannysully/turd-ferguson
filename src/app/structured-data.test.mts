// ------------------------------------------------- what an article is dated

/**
 * Every node that declares itself a piece of writing carries a publication
 * date, or is recorded here with the reason it does not.
 *
 * Form 2 of the queue's method aimed at this file: the walk is exactly right -
 * every block on every page - and the four rules above are all about *shape*.
 * Does it parse, does an `@id` resolve, is an FAQ string on the page, is a URL
 * a route. An `Article` announcing itself to an answer engine with no date on
 * it passes every one of them, the same way an `Offer` carrying the wrong
 * number did until `price-schema.test.mts`.
 *
 * `config/posts.ts` already treats this as settled for the blog and says why
 * in its own header: `datePublished` "was the other retyped fact", so the
 * registry date is the single source and the three `BlogPosting` nodes derive
 * it. **Three `Article` nodes sit outside that rule entirely** - and blocked.md
 * item 10 names two of them. The third is `/case-studies/vibe-retail`, which is
 * the page publishing this site's only attested client figures, and AGENTS.md
 * is explicit that a number about a client's result carries `[VERIFY]` until
 * there is a dated source. So the one undated article that matters most was the
 * one missing from the list. Same shape as blocked 29, where a count of five
 * was fourteen: **a hand-written list of surfaces is not a census**, and both
 * were found by walking rather than by remembering.
 *
 * This dates nothing - that is Danny's call, either a date each or a decision
 * that they are evergreen and should be `WebPage`. What it does is stop the
 * absence being prose. The device is the one `organization-entity.test.mts`
 * uses for `sameAs`: the day one of these gains a `datePublished` the entry
 * below stops being true and the test says so, so the answer cannot half-land
 * across three pages.
 *
 * **What it cannot see, and why that is safe rather than lucky:** schema.org
 * allows `"@type"` to be an array, and `WRITING.has()` on an array is false,
 * so such a node drops out of both counts. Nothing on this site types one
 * today. It fails in the harmless direction either way: an *undated* node
 * going to array form leaves `undated` and the equality below fires, while a
 * *dated* one going missing costs a count on a node that already carries the
 * thing being checked. Recorded rather than guarded, because a guard that
 * cannot fire is deleted in this tree, not tested.
