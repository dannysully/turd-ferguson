/**
 * What the page looks like when the trigger never arrives.
 *
 * `motion-script.test.mts` opens its last three tests with this claim:
 *
 *   "the from-states in globals.css are all scoped to html[data-motion="on"],
 *    so a visitor who never gets that attribute sees the finished page rather
 *    than an invisible one. On an AI visibility product that is the property
 *    that matters most on the site."
 *
 * Then it tests the script. All three assert that `data-motion` is not set -
 * under reduced motion, with no IntersectionObserver - and not one of them
 * reads `globals.css`. The stated property is about the stylesheet and the
 * evidence is about the trigger, so the sentence is carried by a check that
 * cannot fail if it stops being true. That is the species `75ff8d6` went after
 * one level up: a test passing because something else nearby is right.
 *
 * Nothing here is a live defect. The tree is clean under both rules below and
 * each is proved against an injected instance before being committed. What was
 * missing is that either could be broken by one ordinary edit - a new animating
 * class, or a from-state written the way every other from-state on the web is
 * written - with every existing test still green.
 *
 * ## Two rules, and they fail in different rooms
 *
 * **1. No rest state outside `html[data-motion="on"]`.** The attribute is only
 * set by the script, and only after it has cleared `prefers-reduced-motion` and
 * `IntersectionObserver`. So an unscoped from-state is one that applies with no
 * JavaScript at all: a crawler renders the page and finds the placement table
 * and the prompt list empty. That is the whole product's subject matter.
 *
 * **2. A class that carries content never rests invisible, even when the
 * attribute IS set.** This is the room the first rule cannot see into, and it
 * is not hypothetical here. `data-motion="on"` is set before first paint;
 * `.in-view` arrives only when IntersectionObserver delivers - and the note at
 * the foot of docs/inbox.md records the cloud session measuring exactly the
 * state where it does not, because a background tab has `document.hidden` and
 * Chrome suspends rAF and IO delivery with it. In that window every `.ac-row`
 * sits at its rest opacity indefinitely. The boards' `acIn` goes 0 -> 1;
 * globals.css deliberately departs from them and comes up from .55 instead,
 * and says why. A later edit restoring the board's 0 would be faithful to the
 * artboard, pass rule 1, pass every test in the repo, and blank the page for
 * anyone who opened it in a background tab.
 *
 * The same holds for the keyframe rather than the rule: `.in-view` sets
 * `animation: ... both`, and `both` means the element holds the keyframe's
 * from-state through its stagger delay. So the `from` block is a rest state too
 * and is checked as one.

 * joins `SEL` and this file needs no edit. `.seq-*` is deliberately out of

 * it waits. Danny's instruction on 20 Sep took `.ac-row` to 0.15 to make the
 * entrance read, which argues with that rule directly - and he asked for the
 * rule to be restated rather than deleted.
 *
 * So the property has changed shape. It used to be "a waiting element is
 * legible", held by a number. It is now "a waiting element cannot wait
 * indefinitely", held by the failsafe in `motion-script.ts` and checked by
 * `the failsafe that lets rule 2 be this low` below. What survives as a number
 * is only the weaker half: **present rather than absent.** A from-state of
 * literally 0, or so close to it that the element cannot be seen at all, is
 * still refused - a visitor who looks at the page during the failsafe window
 * should see something arriving rather than a blank area that later fills in,
 * and an element at 0 with a failsafe that regresses is a blank page again.
 *
 * 0.1 rather than 0.15, deliberately: this is the floor, not the value. Pinning
 * it to exactly what the CSS says today would make the test a copy of the thing
 * it checks - the blind-tripwire recipe this repo has been bitten by four
 * times - and would fail on any future amplitude tweak that is not a defect.

 * it was written for.** A media query adds no specificity, and every rule it
 * exists to cancel carries one class more than it does - the trigger.
 * `html[data-motion="on"] .ac-row.in-view` is (0,3,1); the neutralising list
 * was (0,2,1). So it won the *rest* state, which is why nothing was ever stuck
 * invisible, and lost the *animation*: a visitor who turned the setting on
 * mid-session kept every row animating as they scrolled to it. Fixed by
 * matching the triggered state at its own specificity; these two rules are
 * what stop it drifting back.
 *
 * Both sides are derived from the stylesheet, so a seventh animating class
 * joins both rules by existing. That matters more here than usual: the six
 * `.ac-*` classes are checked by everything else in this file, and the eleven
 * `.seq-*` ones are checked by nothing at all - they render only inside a live
 * scan, which is the board nobody has ever watched (blocked.md 15).
 *
 * What this cannot do is match selectors the way a browser does. Coverage is
 * judged on the class set - a neutralising selector whose classes are a subset
 * of an animating one's matches at least the same elements - and `:is()` is
 * expanded to its alternatives, its specificity taken as the maximum, which is
 * what the spec says it is. Both are exact for this stylesheet and would want
 * revisiting for a selector using a combinator to mean something narrower.
