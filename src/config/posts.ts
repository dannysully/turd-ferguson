 * title case, so the page said "How LLMs pick which brands to recommend" and
 * the tab, the SERP result and the share card said "How LLMs Pick Which
 * Brands to Recommend". Sentence case is the rule on every other title on the
 * site and on the h1 six lines below the one that broke it.
 *
 * The descriptions stay arguments, because the SERP one and the share one
 * differ on purpose. **The sentence that used to follow - "nothing else on the
 * site holds a second copy of either" - was false, and it was the premise that
 * kept the third surface out of this file.** `blogPostingSchema` took a loose
 * `description: string`, so every post typed one of these two strings a second
 * time by hand. Two posts copied the share line and the third copied the SERP
 * line, and because neither copy referenced anything, nothing could say that
 * the three posts had answered the same question three different ways.
 *
 * It takes the whole `copy` object now, so the second typing is gone by
 * construction rather than by a rule. See `blogPostingSchema` for which of the
 * two it reads and why.

 * announced a different article from the one it was attached to. On a site
 * that sells being the entity an answer engine recognises, that is the exact
 * drift we tell clients to fix.
 *
 * `datePublished` was the other retyped fact. The registry date is what the
 * index sorts on, so the two could disagree about when a post was published
 * and only one of them would move it up the page.
 *
 * **`description` was the third, and it was the one still loose.** This took a
 * bare string, so each page typed a fourth description beside its SERP one and
 * its share one. Read off the shipped prerenders on 20 Sep 2026: two posts had
 * copied the share line into it and one had copied the SERP line, so the node
 * an answer engine reads was a hand copy of a different surface on different
 * posts, and a rewrite of either line would have left it behind in silence.
 *
 * It reads `copy.description` - the SERP line - because that field and this one
 * answer the same question, "summarise this article for a machine", where the
 * share line is a hook written to be clicked. That collapses the two posts
 * whose node had copied the hook onto their fuller summary; nothing is lost,
 * since both hooks still publish on the share card where they were written to
 * go. `post-description.test.mts` reads the join back off the built bytes.
