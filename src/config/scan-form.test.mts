/**
 * Every `<form action="/scan" method="get">` on the site, and the one field
 * each of them posts.
 *
 * The cloud session measured three of these unbounded on 20 September 2026 by
 * loading `/`, `/seo-agencies` and `/pr-agencies` and reading the DOM. There
 * are **five**: the other two are on `/case-studies/vibe-retail` and inside
 * `PostShell`, which every blog post renders. Neither was in the measurement,
 * so neither was in the finding - the same denominator defect this queue keeps
 * naming, arrived at this time by walking pages instead of reading sources.
 *
 * A browser is the only thing that can confirm the bound is *served*; a source
 * census is the only thing that can confirm it is on *all of them*. This is the
 * second, and it is why the count is asserted rather than the pages.
 *
 * The bound is not a security control - the value goes into a URL the server
 * normalises and validates, and `23f8791` established a GET cannot start a
 * pass. It is a consistency rule, and a rule applied at three call sites out of
 * five is the thing this repo files as a defect.
