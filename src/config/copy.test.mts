/**
 * The copy conventions, swept rather than remembered.
 *
 * Three rules in AGENTS.md are absolute, apply to every file that ships text,
 * and have each been checked by hand on separate runs: the brand never takes a
 * capital, tier names are one lowercase word, and the scan's question count is
 * never typed. Those manual checks cost a grep and a paragraph of worklog every
 * time, and the paragraph is the only record that the check happened - so the
 * next run cannot tell a sweep that found nothing from a sweep that was not
 * done. This file is that check, executed.
 *
 * It exists because the fifth of those hand sweeps missed one. Every earlier
 * pass looked for `14`, and the confirm screen's cluster standfirst said
 * "fourteen variations of the same thing" - the same claim, spelled as a word,
 * 400 lines under a comment congratulating itself on having removed the last
 * typed copy from that file. Lower QUESTIONS and the sentence a visitor reads
 * while dropping clusters states a number the product has stopped doing.
 *
 * What this does NOT cover, said plainly rather than implied:
 *
 *  - comments. A comment that says "fourteen questions across four engines is
 *    56 reads" is worked arithmetic for a maintainer, not a claim to a reader,
 *    and there is nowhere to interpolate a constant into one. Several such
 *    comments are in the tree on purpose. The rule is about the strings that
 *    reach a person outside this repo.
 *  - colour. "Colour must never be the only way to tell tiers apart" is a
 *    property of the rendered page and is not decidable from source.
 *
 * The engine count used to be on that list, on the grounds that it "shares its
 * wording with the coverage checker's own three engines, five questions - a
 * different product with its own numbers". It is covered now, because that
 * premise stopped being true on 20 September 2026. Danny accepted proposal 4,
 * "the scan's own engine set", and `20260920010000_campaign_benchmark.sql` is
 * built on it: a benchmark reading is a scans row, so it inherits FREE_ENGINES
 * rather than having a set of its own. There is one engine set on this site,
 * and the exemption was the only thing keeping /coverage-check's "three
 * engines, five questions, fifteen answers" off this report while the product
 * behind it returned twenty.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------- dashes

/**
 * Hyphens, not em-dashes. The site's own punctuation, and the one place the
 * characters are legitimate is the entity decoder, whose whole job is to turn
 * `&mdash;` in a crawled page into the character it stands for.
 *
 * ## Why this stopped being a `Set` of filenames
 *
 * It was `new Set(["src/lib/scan/prose.ts"])` - a whole file switched off on
 * the strength of the sentence above, which is the exemption species this tree
 * has now paid for three times. `PRICE_EXEMPT` was file-keyed until `d8200bb`,
 * where one attested `$1,300` on a four-hundred-line case study switched the
 * price sweep off across the page most likely to grow a "from $2,495" in a
 * closing CTA. `ENGINE_EXEMPT` checked its filenames and not its reasons. This
 * was both at once, and worse in one respect than either: **it was absent from
 * both of the exemption audits at the bottom of this same file**, which
 * enumerate `PRICE_EXEMPT` and `ENGINE_EXEMPT` by hand. So the rule written
 * because "an exemption is a sweep switched off, and the sentence beside it is
 * the only argument for switching it off" did not know this exemption existed.
 *
 * `prose.ts` is 223 lines and only three of them carry a dash - all six
 * characters are values in the two decoding tables. The other 220 lines are
 * `toProse`, which builds **the only string the brand read is ever given**;
 * its own header says a character mangled on the way through "is not a
 * rendering blemish, it is the input to the one judgement this step makes". A
 * separator typed as an em-dash in that function was exempt by construction.
 *
 * So the exemption is narrowed the way `PRICE_EXEMPT`'s was: to the shape of
 * the line that earns it. A dash is allowed in `prose.ts` when it is the value
 * of a table entry - `ndash: "–",` or `0x96: "–",` - and nowhere else in the
 * file. `holds` re-earns the reason itself, because a file keeping its name
 * while its decoder moves out is the `e3bf2d9` shape one layer down.

 *  - TRACKED_QUESTIONS is what the $99 tracking price covers. It was typed on

/**
 * A question count typed into the shipped text.
 *
 * Two spellings, and the word form is the one that matters, because it is the
 * one that survived. Every earlier sweep looked for the digit.
 *
 * The digit is only a hit beside the word "question". `14px` is a font size on
 * nearly every line of this codebase, `> 200` is a length bound and `status:
 * 404` is a status - none of them are claims about the product, and a rule
 * that flagged them would be turned off within a week.
 *
 * The word carries no such qualifier, deliberately. "fourteen" is in this
 * product's copy for one reason, and requiring "question" on the same line
 * would have missed the second hit this rule was written for - a prompt in
 * anthropic.ts reading "well measured by fourteen versions of...", where the
 * subject of the sentence is the question set and the word is not on the line.
 *
 * ## Why a CSS length is cut out before the digit is looked for
 *
 * "`14px` is a font size on nearly every line" is what the qualifier above is
 * for, and it holds right up until a line is both - which the benchmark
 * reading page produced on its first run:
 *
 *     <span style={{ fontSize: "14.5px", color: T.ink }}>{q.question}</span>
 *
 * `\b14\b` matches inside "14.5px" because the decimal point ends the word, and
 * `{q.question}` satisfies the qualifier. So the sweep reported a typed
 * question count on a line that states one nowhere - a styled element that
 * renders a question, which is the most ordinary thing a page that lists
 * questions can contain.
 *
 * A false positive on this rule is not harmless. It is a push gate, the fix a
 * reader reaches for is to reword copy that was already right, and the second
 * time it fires on markup the rule gets an exemption entry that turns it off
 * for a whole file.
 *
 * So lengths go before the digit is looked for, rather than the qualifier being
 * loosened. Nothing real is lost: a claim about the product never writes its
 * number as `14px` or `14.5rem`, and the word form - the spelling this rule was
 * written for and the one that actually went stale - is untouched by it.

 * switched off, which is exactly the state `DASH_EXEMPT` was found in. So the
 * denominator is read out of this file's own source - the move
 * `price-schema.test.mts` makes to refuse a second floor judgement, and the
 * move `client-results.test.mts` makes to walk the tree rather than name it.
 *
 * **No comment strip here, deliberately, and that is not the usual mistake.**
 * Five rules in this tree read source and all five strip prose first, because
 * a doc comment quoting a defect satisfies a check that the defect is present.
 * The strip would be decoration in this one: the pattern is anchored at column
 * zero with `^const`, and every comment form this repo writes indents its
 * continuation lines (` *` in a JSDoc, `//` on each line) - so the paragraph
 * above, which names `DASH_EXEMPT` twice while explaining it, cannot match.
 * A guard that cannot fire is deleted here rather than tested, the way
 * `price-label.ts`'s empty-figure guard was.
 *
 * **What this cannot see: an exemption list in a different test file.** Asked
 * of this rule the moment it went green, because every blind tripwire in this
 * tree read as a reasonable check with a reason beside it a run later. Six
 * exemption lists exist across four files - the three here, `route-closure`'s
 * `/scan`, `spend-gates`' `{ why, evidence, where }` and `input-bounds`'
 * `{ why, holds }` - and all four files audit their own, checked by hand on
 * 20 Sep 2026.
 *
 * The tree-wide version was drafted and **deliberately not written, because it
 * would not have caught the defect it was for.** The only structurally
 * checkable form is "every `*EXEMPT*` declared in a test is referenced inside
 * a `test()` body in the same file", and `DASH_EXEMPT` satisfied that
 * throughout: it fed `DASH_HITS`, which a test asserted on. What it was not
 * inside was the two rules that audit exemptions, and "audited" is not a
 * property source can be read for. A rule that passes on the instance it was
 * written for is decoration, and this repo deletes those rather than shipping
 * them.
