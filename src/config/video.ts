 * The launch video on /how-it-works, as one record (Q23, 26 Sep 2026; re-cut
 * R118, 29 Sep 2026).
 *
 * A video is a rendered file: nothing in it updates when the site does. So
 * everything the page, the JSON-LD and the text summary say about it lives
 * here, and `video.test.mts` holds the parts that can drift - the files, the
 * duration, and above all the prices - against the tree.
 *
 * `shownPrices` is what the video paints as a price, in tier order. The first
 * cut painted $99 / $995 / $2,495 and went stale when the pricing spec moved
 * them (off the site 28 Sep). The re-cut (Danny, 29 Sep, danny.md line 110)
 * shows no price at all, so it is empty: there is nothing in the file for
 * pricing.ts to drift away from. If a re-render paints a price again, record
 * it here and the test holds it to pricing.ts.
