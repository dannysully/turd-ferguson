/**
 * Every field in the tree a stranger can type into, and whether anything bounds
 * what they can put in it.
 *
 * `scan-form.test.mts` is the same question asked of a denominator one form
 * wide: `<form action="/scan" method="get">`. It is correct about all five of
 * those and could not see any of these, which is the defect this queue keeps
 * naming arriving for the sixth time. Widening the denominator from "the /scan
 * GET forms" to "every input" found six unbounded fields in three files:
 *
 *   - four on `CoverageForm`, the form that spends money, whose route had its
 *     own table of limits typed inline - the fourth table `contact.ts` predicted
 *     in as many words;
 *   - the category field on `ConfirmScreen`, which is where a question is
 *     edited before it is billed, while its own question rows one screen down
 *     were bounded;
 *   - the email field on `ScanFlow`, while the same field on `RequestScanForm`
 *     was bounded.
 *
 * None of the six was a hole: every route already refused an over-length value.
 * What each one was is a refusal the visitor cannot act on, because `text()`
 * and its callers return the same message for too-short and too-long, and the
 * message describes the short case. The bound on the input is what makes that
 * branch unreachable from the form.
 *
 * The count is asserted, not the files. A census that silently narrows reads
 * exactly like a clean sweep - see the four blind tests in the queue.
 *
 * ## The walk was narrower than the heading, which is this file's own species
 *
 * Everything above was written under the heading "every `<input>` in the tree"
 * and the scanner matched `<input\b`. A `<textarea>` is a field a stranger
 * types into, it takes `maxLength`, and it was outside the denominator
 * entirely - so the check that exists to ask "is this bounded" could not ask it
 * of the **longest** free-text field on the site: `c-msg`, the 5000-character
 * contact message, which becomes the body of an email and is reflected back
 * into HTML on an error.
 *
 * Measured, not argued: deleting `maxLength={CONTACT_LIMITS.message}` from that
 * textarea left all 488 tests passing. There was no hole - the field is
 * bounded, and `contact/actions.ts` refuses an over-length message besides -
 * but nothing in this tree could have told you if it stopped being.
 *
 * `TAGS` is the fix and it is the thing to extend: a field type that accepts
 * typed text and honours `maxLength` belongs in it. `<select>` does not (it has
 * no free text) and there is no `contentEditable` anywhere in `src`; both were
 * checked rather than assumed, so the next run does not re-derive them.

// ------------------------------------------- does any server read this bound?

/**
 * Every bound this file declares, and the server that enforces it.
 *
 * ## The defect this was written for
 *
 * `SCAN_LIMITS.email` is 254. `ScanFlow` carries it as `maxLength`. The test
 * above asserts the number under the heading "the bounds are the numbers the
 * servers actually enforce". All three of those were true and **no server
 * enforced it**: `/api/scan/[token]/unlock` read `body.email` off the request
 * JSON, tested it against `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[a-z]{2,}$/i` - two unbounded runs
 * either side of an `@` - and passed it to the `to:` header of a Resend send, to
 * a `leads` insert whose column is `text`, to `resolveAccount`, which creates an
 * `accounts` row from it, and back out in its own response body.
 *
 * Nothing in this tree could see that. The route check above walks a **typed**
 * list of three routes and asks whether each reads the right constant; a bound
 * read by nobody is not a wrong constant, it is an absent one, and absence is
 * what a typed list is structurally unable to report. `contact.test.mts` reads
 * one file. `email-header.test.mts` sweeps every `emails.send` in the tree for a
 * safe subject and then bounds the fields of exactly one action, `waitlist.ts`,
 * named by hand - its own header says "a third form is one entry from being
 * covered by both", which is the admission that the second half is a typed list
 * too. So the bound half of "what a sender owes" had a denominator of one file
 * while the subject half had a denominator of the tree.
 *
 * ## What this walks, and why it is the whole set
 *
 * The tables in this file are the only place a bound is allowed to come from -
 * the check above fails a `maxLength={120}` typed as a literal - so every bound
 * on the site is a key in one of them. That makes the key set the denominator,
 * and it is derived here by parsing this file rather than typed, so a fifth
 * table joins the sweep by existing.
 *
 * A "server" is any `.ts` in the tree that is not a component, not a test and
 * not this file: that covers `route.ts`, both `"use server"` actions and
 * anything under `lib`. `.tsx` is excluded deliberately - a `maxLength` is the
 * bound this census exists to distrust.

 *     `questions` on a length, `coverage-check` through `text()`, which
 *     compares both ends and returns null;
 *   - clamp - `waitlist.ts` on all four of its fields, and the two honeypots on
 *     the way to a log.
 *
 * The one shape that would have made this pay is a clamp that lands *before* a
 * refusal on the same string, which makes the refusal unreachable: the visitor
 * is silently truncated where the code says they are told. `contact/actions.ts`
 * looks like that and is not - it clamps into `values`, the echo handed back to
 * the form, and tests the unclamped locals. Read those eleven lines before
 * believing otherwise.
 *
 * So there is no live defect here and, by this queue's rule for a guard with no
 * observable effect, a check for it would be decoration today. What was found
 * instead by asking the question one level up - does this file's WALK match its
 * own HEADING - is the textarea above and the `topic_variants` pair below.
