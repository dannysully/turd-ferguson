/**
 * Every colour value written in shipped source, and whether the palette
 * contains it.
 *
 * ## The claim this was written for
 *
 * `config/tokens.ts` opens: "There is one palette now, and this is it. No file
 * defines the old values any more - the `C` object on the ops page is a set of
 * named aliases onto these." Three clauses, and the census in
 * `docs/prose-claims.mjs` found it by the second one. Measured on
 * 20 September 2026:
 *
 * - "No file defines the old values any more" - **true**. `#0B1220`, `#F8F7FF`,
 *   `#0D1B2A`, `#D85A30` and the Georgia stack appear nowhere in `src`.
 * - "the `C` object is a set of named aliases onto these" - **true**. All eight
 *   members of `C` in `admin/scans/page.tsx` are `T.` reads.
 * - "There is one palette now, and this is it" - **false**. Fifteen hex values
 *   and six `rgba()` values are written outside this file, at 47 sites. And the
 *   file offered as the evidence for the sentence, the ops page, carries eight
 *   of them one line away from the `C` object that makes the clause true.
 *
 * That is the shape `1ff1336` records: a true clause joined to a false one is
 * what makes a sentence read as settled.
 *
 * ## Why nothing could see it
 *
 * `contrast.test.mts` reads every colour on this site and asks whether it is
 * **readable on its ground**. This asks whether it is **in the palette**, and
 * the two come apart in the direction that matters: a hand-typed hex that
 * clears AA is invisible to the contrast sweep while looking straight at it.
 * That is not hypothetical. `verify-email.ts` records two of exactly these -
 * "#f6f6f8 where the ground is #f6f6f7, #eceef2 where the rule is #ececee" -
 * which went "straight through a sweep that moved all 21 pages onto the
 * tokens".
 *
 * **One place in this tree already solved that, and it is worth saying which,
 * because it narrows what is new here.** `email-render.test.mts` holds the
 * email: "no colour outside the palette reaches the inbox" walks the rendered
 * markup for a hex outside `E`, and "the email palette is the tokens, plus
 * only its documented departures" pins `body:#3d4451` as the only literal
 * allowed in it. Both are good and neither is replaced by anything here.
 *
 * What was missing is that **the denominator stopped at that one module.** It
 * is `contact.test.mts` again - correct about every colour it named, reading
 * one file - while 47 sites across twenty other files had nothing at all. The
 * email was the only surface on this product whose palette was closed.
 *
 * It also needs no build, where `contrast.test.mts` skips without one: a value
 * typed into a server module never reaches a rendered page at all.
 *
 * ## How an entry earns its place, and who decides
 *
 * Not by my taste. `docs/design/` holds the 23 artboards, and the question
 * "did somebody type this, or did the design draw it" is answered by grepping
 * them. Measured 20 September 2026, and it split the set cleanly:
 *
 * - ten of the fifteen hex values are drawn by between two and 23 boards. They
 *   are palette members that never got a name, not typos.
 * - `#3d4451` and `#92400e` are drawn by **no board at all**, and both sit in
 *   the two files no page sweep can reach - the transactional email, which is
 *   not a page, and the ops page, which answers 401 (blocked.md 19).
 *
 * The boards are untracked, so this file cannot read them; the count and the
 * date are recorded per entry instead, and what is re-earned in-tree is the
 * **occurrence**: the files a value may appear in and how many times in each.
 * Keyed that way rather than to a file for the reason the queue records - an
 * exemption keyed to a FILE excuses whatever lands in it next - and counted per
 * file because two of these files carry the same value twice.
 *
 * ## Two things it cannot see, asked while the denominator is fresh
 *
 * - **A colour built rather than written.** `T.accent + "22"`, a template
 *   literal, a value out of a `.json`. Nothing here parses expressions. The one
 *   live instance of the shape is `rgba(124,58,237,0.28)` in `globals.css`, and
 *   it is not on the list below: rule 2 derives it from `T.accent` instead,
 *   because a value that can be proved should not be excused.
 * - **A colour named rather than numbered.** `red`, `white`, `transparent` are
 *   CSS keywords and no rule here matches one. Checked rather than assumed:
 *   `color: white` and `background: red` appear nowhere in `src`, so there is
 *   no live instance and a rule for it would be decoration today.

 * blocked.md 31 is open on. The queue's own rule is that the stylesheet is a
 * fourth surface every page sweep here was blind to, so a palette census that
 * skipped it would be making the same mistake one file along.
 *
 * **The stylesheets are walked for, not typed.** The first draft of this file

 * Rule 5: the one entry that justifies itself with a number re-earns it.
 *
 * `verify-email.ts` departs from the palette on purpose and says why: "#3d4451
 * measures 9.79 on white where `T.soft` is 4.68". Both halves are exact - and a
 * reason stated as a measurement is the kind that rots silently, because
 * changing the value leaves the sentence behind. This is the `holds` shape
 * `input-bounds` records: the reason costs an assertion.
 *
 * **Both sides are read out of that file, and the first draft of this rule read
 * neither.** It compared a typed `"#3d4451"` against a typed `9.79` - two
 * constants inside this test, agreeing with each other for ever, on a tree that
 * could have said anything. The injection harness is what said so: changing the
 * value was caught by rules 3 and 4 and never by this one, which is the
 * blind-tripwire recipe the queue names - when a test duplicates a value to
 * compare against, ask what reads the original.
 *
 * **Why this is not `email-render.test.mts`'s AA rule under another name.**
 * That rule opens "Measured, not asserted from the doc comment. verify-email.ts
 * claims '#3d4451 measures 9.79 on white where T.soft is 4.68' and both check
 * out below" - and what it actually asserts is `r >= 4.5` on every pair. It is
 * a floor, so it is true of `#5d6471` too, and the stated 9.79 would go on
 * sitting in the comment beside a value that no longer produces it. The heading
 * claims the join and the body asserts a bound, which is the same gap
 * `input-bounds` records about its own "the bounds are the numbers the servers
 * actually enforce". This is the join.
