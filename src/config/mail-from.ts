/**
 * The address every message this product sends comes from, decided once.
 *
 * It was decided four times. `process.env.SCAN_FROM_EMAIL ?? "alwayscited
 * <onboarding@resend.dev>"` was typed verbatim in `app/contact/actions.ts`,
 * `app/actions/waitlist.ts` and twice in `lib/scan/verify-email.ts` - the
 * verification mail and the report mail - with no constant anywhere. That is
 * the species this tree keeps paying for: the date formatter existed twice and
 * the untested copy was the one missing a guard, the honeypot existed twice
 * and the untested copy was the one missing the field, the contact address was
 * typed thirteen times before `CONTACT_EMAIL` (`349dcda`).
 *
 * **What was watching it, and why that is not the same as reading it.**
 * `readiness.test.mts` asserts `senders.length >= 3` over files containing the
 * string `SCAN_FROM_EMAIL`, which justifies the variable's place on the
 * readiness list. A count floor cannot notice one whole sender dropping off -
 * the same shape `input-bounds.test.mts` records about `TAGS` - and it says
 * nothing at all about what the four fall back TO. `email-header.test.mts`
 * does walk every `emails.send` in the tree, and reads one field of the five:
 * the subject. The address on the envelope was read by nothing.
 *
 * **The rename this exists for is not hypothetical.** blocked.md 20 is open
 * because `resend.dev` is a domain this project does not own, and closing it
 * means editing the fallback. Four sites in three files is the size at which
 * `CONTACT_EMAIL`'s own note says a grep-driven rename leaves copies behind -
 * and the two that read least like copy are the two in `verify-email.ts`, one
 * of which is the unlock mail that blocked.md 20 names as the thing a
 * visitor's address is traded for.
 *
 * `mail-from.test.mts` holds both directions: nothing else types the literal
 * or reads the variable, and every send in the tree takes its `from` from
 * here.

 * than a hard failure on purpose: a deployment with `RESEND_API_KEY` set and
 * this unset should still deliver the unlock mail somebody traded an address

 * go out with an empty From and Resend refuses every one of them. Three of the
