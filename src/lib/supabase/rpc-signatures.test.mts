/**
 * Every `.rpc()` names a function some migration declares, with the argument
 * names that function's signature takes.
 *
 * **The two-way street, and `writes.test.mts` is the file that paves one side
 * of it.** That sweep walks `supabase/migrations`, decides which database
 * functions mutate, and uses the set to CLASSIFY a call - `MUTATING.has(name)`
 * says whether a `.rpc(` is a write and therefore whether its error has to be
 * looked at. Nothing anywhere walks the other way and asks whether the name in
 * the call is a function at all. Its own header worries about exactly this
 * disappearance for a *computed* name - "`db.rpc(fnName, ...)` has no name to
 * look up, so it could not be classified as a write and would drop out of this
 * sweep silently" - and closes it with a rule. A name spelled as a literal and
 * spelled WRONG drops out by the identical mechanism, and no rule closes that.
 *
 * Same species as `upsert-conflict.test.mts` one Postgres-name-in-a-string
 * over: `onConflict` is a string in TypeScript and the constraint is DDL in a
 * `.sql` file, so no type, no import and no build step reads both ends. An RPC
 * name and its parameter names are the same join with the same absence of one.
 *
 * **What it costs when it is wrong.** PostgREST resolves a function by schema,
 * name **and the set of argument names supplied**, so all three of these are
 * one error - `PGRST202`, *Could not find the function public.x(...) in the
 * schema cache*:
 *
 *  - a misspelled name. This tree ships `note_preview_call` and
 *    `note_preview_calls`, two live functions one character apart, called
 *    thirty-one lines apart in the same file, doing different things - one
 *    reserves against a ceiling and returns a count, the other settles the
 *    actual spend and returns void;
 *  - a renamed parameter. `p_window_hours` is typed in one place and declared
 *    in another, and nothing joins them;
 *  - a parameter dropped from the call, or one added to the migration.
 *
 * None of the three moves `tsc`: supabase-js types `rpc(fn: string, args?:
 * object)` against generated database types this repo does not generate, so the
 * name and the arguments are unchecked strings. None of the three moves the
 * build. And the three routes it lands hardest on are the ceilings -
 * `note_scan_spend`, `note_preview_call`, `note_verify_send` - which is the one
 * family of write whose failure reads as "nothing has happened yet".
 *
 * All seven call sites are correct today, checked 20 Sep 2026. This exists so
 * that stays a fact rather than a coincidence.
