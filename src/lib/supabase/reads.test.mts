/**
 * Every Supabase read must look at its own error.

 * `{ data: null, error: {...} }`, so `const { data } = await db.from(...)` is
 * indistinguishable from a read that succeeded and found nothing - and the code
 * after it then states the wrong one of those two as a fact. Found in eleven
 * places on 19 September 2026, and it was never a cosmetic difference:
 *
 *  - the verify link redirected to "that link does not match a report we hold,
 *    run a scan below", to somebody who had just proved their address, because
 *    a read did not answer;
 *  - the scan page rendered its 404 to somebody following the link to their own
 *    report;
 *  - the pipeline read no confirmed questions, so it wrote a fresh set and
 *    asked those instead - and the report only ever shows what was asked, so
 *    nobody outside could tell;
 *  - the gated pass wrote its engines over `engines_answered` rather than into
 *    it, so an unlocked report said the free engines had not answered;
 *  - `billedOnto` added this pass's spend to zero and wrote the total back,
 *    erasing what the earlier pass had cost - under the two ceilings that read
 *    those columns to bound the day's spend. That read is gone rather than
 *    fixed: the addition happens in the database now, through
 *    `note_scan_spend`, which also closes the overlap two correct reads still
 *    lost.
 *
 * A list of call sites written into this test would drift exactly the way the
 * comments promising "this is handled" drifted. So it reads the source and
 * asserts over what it finds, and every exemption below has to say why.

 * what it covered was one of the two shapes a read comes in.
 *
