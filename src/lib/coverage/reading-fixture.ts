/**
 * The reading fixture (R151, 1 Oct 2026). `COVERAGE_FIXTURE_STATE` set to
 * complete, running, failed or stalled makes `/coverage-check/fixture` render
 * that state from made-up rows, so the four states of the reading page can be
 * shot without a real campaign token or a database - none existed in the repo
 * when the page's one-primary-action fix shipped, and it went out unseen.
 *
 * Only the token `fixture` answers; every other token still reads the database.
 * Never in production: with `VERCEL_ENV=production` set alongside the switch it
 * throws, the same refusal as `TRACKING_FIXTURE` (tracking/fixture-mode.ts).
 *
 * The brand is the placeholder `[Client brand]`, so a shot of it can never be
 * read as a measurement of anyone real.
