/**
 * A campaign reading, assembled for the page that shows it.
 *
 * Every figure on this page is counted here from stored rows. None of them is
 * typed, and none of them is a model's opinion about what the reading means:
 * "named in 6 of 20 answers" is six rows with `brand_named` true out of twenty
 * rows, and "3 of your 14 placements were cited" is a set intersection. That is
 * the whole reason this product can be given away - it makes no claim it cannot
 * point at a row for.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * No share of voice, no rank against competitors, no verdict. The scan's
 * leaderboard is built on the same row and could be read from here in one more
 * select, and it is left out because a benchmark's five questions are not a
 * category sample - ranking somebody ninth off five questions would be a number
 * with a denominator too small to mean what a reader takes it to mean. The free
 * scan asks a full set and says so.
 *
 * No verbatim answer text either, and that one is load-bearing rather than
 * editorial. `response_text` is cleared by the retention purge on any scan that
 * was never unlocked, and a reading is never unlocked - it takes no email, so
 * nothing ever sets `unlocked_at`. Every reading's prose is therefore gone a
 * week after it was taken, while the columns this page reads - `answered`,
 * `brand_named`, and the citation rows - are kept for good. That is what lets a
 * benchmark promise a dated starting line worth coming back to. Anyone adding
 * the answers themselves to this page is adding something that will be blank on
 * every reading older than `response_retention_days`, with nothing on screen to
 * say why.
