/**
 * The defect this rule is named after shipped in the push that added two rungs,
 * in the one file that change did not otherwise touch.
 *
 * `ScanFlow.tsx` had `setProgress(3)` on `status === "complete"`. It meant "one
 * past the last rung", which `stepPct` answers with `DONE_PCT`, and it was
 * correct for as long as the ladder had three rungs. Adding `brands` and
 * `ranking` turned 3 into a real rung at 91%, so a finished scan would have
 * ended its run by moving the bar *backwards* to 91% and then swapping the
 * panel out. Nothing failed, nothing logged, and the only witness is the one
 * screen on this site nobody has ever watched render.
 *
 * **This is the repo's own named defect species** - "a ladder with a ceiling",
 * a fixed rung picked by index against a list that can grow - and the
 * fixed-index census over `src` was run and declared exhausted earlier the same
 * day. It was: this line was inside it and was correct when it was measured.
 * That is the lesson worth keeping. A census is true on the day it is taken,
 * and the thing that invalidates it is the change you are making right now.
 *
 * ## Why a positive literal and not any literal
 *
 * `setProgress(0)` is fine and stays. A ladder always has a first rung, so zero
 * cannot drift; every other index is a position in a list whose length is the
 * thing that moves. `RUN_STEPS.length` is how you say "done" and
 * `STEP_INDEX.get(word)` is how you say anything else.
 *
 * The denominator is derived - every `.tsx` and `.ts` under `src` that imports
 * from `run-steps` - rather than named, because the next file to render this
 * bar is the one this rule needs to cover and it does not exist yet.
