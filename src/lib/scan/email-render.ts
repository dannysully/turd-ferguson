/**
 * The transactional email markup, with nothing in it that touches the network.
 *
 * Split out of verify-email.ts on 19 Sep 2026 so the messages can actually be
 * rendered. Until now they never had been - not once, in any session. They
 * were typechecked, built, and read back out of the source with a regex, and
 * every claim about them was a claim about the code rather than about the
 * output. blocked.md carried that as an open item for want of a runner.
 *
 * The obstacle was never the markup, it was the imports. verify-email.ts
 * pulls in `server-only`, the Resend SDK and the `@/` path alias, and none of
 * those load under `node --test`. So the part worth checking is here, and the
 * palette and the font arrive as arguments rather than as a dependency. That
 * is what makes `email-render.test.mts` possible, and the test is the reason
 * to prefer it to a tidier import.
 *
 * This file used to import nothing at all, which was the rule as first
 * written. The rule it was really keeping is narrower and is what it now
 * states: **nothing here may import something `node --test` cannot load.**
 * `../plural.ts` qualifies - a relative specifier with its extension, to a
 * module that imports nothing itself - and it is here rather than inlined
 * because the email headline and the report's own h1 are deliberately the
 * same sentence with the same two numbers. Two copies of the agreement rule
 * is how they stop being the same sentence.
 *
 * Everything that decides *what* to send stays in verify-email.ts. This
 * decides only what the message looks like.

 * There was no head element at all, and so no charset. The brand in the

 * on a purple rectangle. mso-padding-alt on the cell puts it back.
