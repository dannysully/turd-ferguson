/**
 * The words `classifyBatch` in anthropic.ts sends when it sorts cited domains
 * into competitor, placement and other.
 *
 * Pure and on its own so `source-kind-prompt.test.mts` can read the rule
 * without the SDK or a network - anthropic.ts is server-only.
 *
 * 25 September 2026 (N9): on scan 28a07760 the placement list carried
 * nextiva.com, getvoip.com, oncehub.com, dapta.ai, herothemes.com and
 * cloudtalk.io - category vendors cited for their own blog posts and
 * listicles. A competitor's blog is not somewhere an agency can place a
 * client. Two things let them through: the prompt called any "blog" or
 * "listicle site" a placement, and the leaderboard it was given was empty,
 * because the classification read `scan_brands` before the brand chain had
 * written it. The rule below settles the first; sources.ts and pipeline.ts
 * settle the second.
