   * recorded as `brand_named === false`, so an empty answer set skips every
   * citation and this returns a flat `count: 0`. Every caller was written

   * that "a failed read reports as a failure rather than as a count of zero,
   * which on this screen would read as 'there is nothing behind the gate'" - and
   * then answered 200 with `ready: true, count: 0`, which is precisely that
   * sentence. `/scan/<token>` calls it inside a try that logs and falls back to
   * the copy with no number in it, and never reached the catch.
   *
   * So a database blip told a visitor standing at the gate that there were no
   * pages to be placed into. That is a measured finding on this product - a real
   * zero is as much an answer as a fourteen - which is exactly why it must never
   * be the thing a failure degrades to. Thrown, and every caller has the

   * count belonged to `buildUnlockPayload` and had drifted onto the wrong
   * function. **A census belongs in a test, not a comment**: a number in prose
   * cannot notice a fourth caller, and the obligation this throw creates lands
   * on callers that do not exist yet. `gate-read-callers.test.mts` walks for
   * them, and holds the other end too - if either of these reads goes back to
   * swallowing its error, every caller's branch becomes dead code and the gate
