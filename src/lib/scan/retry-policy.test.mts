/**
 * Every model call this product makes goes through two retry layers and one
 * counter, and until now none of the three had a check on it: `withRetry` lived
 * in `anthropic.ts`, which opens with `import "server-only"` and imports the
 * SDK, so `node --test` could not load the file.
 *
 * The defect that was in the tree, and what makes this a spend question rather
 * than a logging one: the counter was incremented once per `withRetry` ATTEMPT,
 * while `new Anthropic()` retries 408/409/429/5xx/connection twice of its own
 * inside each attempt (`maxRetries` defaults to 2). So a 529 storm sent up to
 * nine requests and recorded three. `anthropicCallsSince` sums that column into
 * the daily call ceiling, and `spend.ts` says in its own header that the
 * failure that puts a scan on that ceiling "is the repeating kind, which is
 * precisely when this ceiling is the only thing left" - so the ceiling
 * under-reported by 3x on the day it exists for.
 *
 * ## The reader walk is first on purpose
 *
 * A value rule over the helper this run wrote would have passed on the tree
 * that carried the defect, because that tree never called it. Rules 1 to 3 walk
 * the shipped source and ask what reaches a model, so they fail on the tree as
 * it was. The behavioural tests below them are the cheaper half.
 *
 * Source is read through `code`, so a `messages.parse` quoted in a doc comment
 * is not a call and the prose in `anthropic.ts` describing this defect does not
 * satisfy the check written for it.

/**
 * Every `X.messages.<method>(` in a file, as the expression to the left of it
 * paired with the method.
 *
 * **Not `messages.parse` alone.** The first draft of this walk matched that one
 * method, and it was the refill this file's own method predicts: rule 1 counts
 * five `parse` calls, so a sixth call site written `messages.create(` or
 * `messages.stream(` leaves that count at five and is read by rule 2 not at
 * all. The sweep written to stop an uncounted request on the wire would have
 * waved through the cheapest way to put one there, in the flattering direction.
 * The method is the thing that varies; `messages` is the thing that bills.
 *
 * The receiver is what the rules below are about - whether the call was made
 * through a client carrying the billing accumulator - so it is read per CALL
 * rather than per file. `contact.test.mts` records why: a rule satisfied by
 * "the right idiom appears somewhere in this module" is satisfied by the
 * correct call while the one beside it drops it, and this file has five.
