/**
 * Mailing the free result to somebody who asked for it and left - Danny's
 * item 5, and his own idea: everybody who gives up at ninety seconds is
 * currently lost silently.
 *
 * ## One door, two callers, one message
 *
 * The address is given while the scan is running, so the send has to happen
 * from whichever of two places notices the scan is finished:
 *
 * - `runScan`, the moment it writes the completed status. The ordinary case.
 * - the route itself, when the address arrives after the pass has already
 *   completed - which is a real race and not a curiosity, because the offer is
 *   on screen for the whole of the reading phase and a scan can finish while
 *   somebody is typing.
 *
 * Both call this. `claim` is what stops them both sending: a filtered update
 * that stamps `report_email_sent_at` and hands back the address it stamped, so
 * exactly one caller gets a row. That is the same compare-and-swap the confirm
 * route and both passes use, and it is here rather than in either caller for
 * the reason `knownEngines` is not beside either of its readers - it is a fact
 * about the column.
 *
 * ## What it must not promise
 *
 * The message links to `/scan/<token>`, which serves the free result and the
 * gate exactly as the screen would have. So the mail delivers what the visitor
 * was already looking at and nothing the gate withholds - `reportText` says
 * "Open your report" and names no placement list, and
 * `report-mail.test.mts` holds that.
 *
 * Never throws. Both callers are on a path that has already succeeded: one has
 * just completed a paid scan, the other has already answered the visitor.

     * about permission to send and this is about what was sent. A failed stamp
     * costs the join and nothing else, so it is a warning and not a return: the
     * message has gone, and the send must not read as failed because a second
     * write did.

     * each already logged where it happened. It is logged again here because

     * three logs inside `sendReportReadyEmail` record that a send failed, and
