/**
 * The three steps a running scan reports, named once.
 *
 * There were four copies of this vocabulary in three files and nothing
 * reconciled any of them:
 *
 * - `pipeline.ts` wrote `step: "questions"`, `"reading"` and `"sources"` into
 *   `scans.step` as bare literals at three separate call sites.
 * - `ScanFlow.tsx` held a `STEP_INDEX` map turning those three words back into
 *   0, 1, 2 - a second copy of the words, typed by hand.
 * - `HeroSequence.tsx` held `RUN_STEPS`, three captions indexed by that number.
 * - `HeroSequence.tsx` also held `STEP_PCT`, four percentages indexed by the
 *   same number.
 *
 * ## What that cost, and why it is silent
 *
 * Rename a step in the pipeline, or add a fourth, and `STEP_INDEX.get` returns
 * `undefined` for the word it now writes. The reader guards on that - correctly,
 * and for a good reason recorded below - so `setProgress` is simply never
 * called. The bar does not jump or flicker: it **freezes at the previous step,
 * with the previous caption under it, for the rest of the run**, and then the
 * report arrives as though nothing happened. The scan itself is unaffected, so
 * nothing fails, nothing logs, and the only witness is the waiting screen.
 *
 * That screen is `HeroSequence`, which is the one surface on this site nobody
 * has ever watched render - its classes exist only during a live scan. Four
 * defects have already been found on it by reading alone. A fifth that needs a
 * rename to appear is exactly the kind this arrangement was going to produce,
 * so the words and the numbers live here and the three files derive from them.
 *
 * This is the remedy `config/scan-shape.ts` already applies to the question
 * count, for the same reason it gives: a value retyped in a second place is a
 * claim about what the product does that nothing keeps true.
 *
 * ## Why a `.ts` and not a constant in the component
 *
 * `node --test` cannot load a `.tsx`, so anything left inside one is untestable.
 * `motion-script.ts` and `seq-stagger.ts` were both pulled out of components for
 * this reason and both say so. This is a third piece of the same board.
 *
 * No `server-only`: the pipeline writes these keys and two client components
 * read them, so it has to load on both sides. It imports nothing.
 */

 * In the order the pipeline runs them. `key` is the word written to
 * `scans.step`; `caption` is what the visitor is told; `pct` is how far the bar

/**
 * ## Why there are five of these and not three, since 20 September 2026
 *
 * Danny, item 3: "that one caption covers the longest stretch of the scan with
 * the bar frozen at 85%. Split it so the screen moves while it works."
 *
 * `sources` used to cover everything from the last engine read to the finished
 * report - storing citations, one brand extraction per engine, one classify
 * call over the whole name set, and the source classification alongside them.
 * Four API phases under one caption, with the bar not moving for any of it. On
 * a scan where the reads finish fast and the model work does not, that is most
 * of the visible wait spent looking at a frozen 85%.
 *
 * The two new rungs are the two phases that were already separately measurable
 * and are now separately *visible*: `brands` is `extractBrands`, `ranking` is
 * `classifyBrands`. They are named for what is happening rather than for how
 * far along it is, because "almost done" is a promise this pipeline cannot
 * keep - the deadline is a ceiling, not an estimate.
 *
 * **The source classification is deliberately not a rung.** Since the same
 * commit it runs *alongside* `brands` and `ranking` rather than after them, so
 * there is no moment at which it is the thing being waited for. A caption for
 * it would be a lie about what the bar is measuring - the one thing this module
 * was built to prevent.
 *
 * Nothing needed changing to add them. Both readers derive - `HeroSequence`
 * calls `stepCaption`/`stepPct`, `ScanFlow` reads `STEP_INDEX` - which is the
 * whole argument this file's header makes, tested by having been true.
