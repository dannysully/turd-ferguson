/**
 * `readSearchVolumes` was here and came out on 20 September 2026.
 *
 * It called `/v3/ai_optimization/ai_keyword_data/keywords_search_volume/live`
 * once per scan for the whole question set. Removed on Danny's instruction: it
 * was a serial third-party round trip inside the phase the progress bar holds
 * at 85%, for a figure this site already tells visitors it does not use.
 *
 * That last part is not a rationalisation after the fact - it is published
 * copy on two surfaces and it predates the removal. The homepage FAQ answers
 * "Why is there no search volume anywhere in this?" with a dated reading
 * ("On a real scan we ran in September, every question came back at zero
 * volume"), and the confirm screen's own footer reads "No search volume
 * against them, deliberately". The code was paying for the number on every
 * scan while both surfaces said we do not use one; the removal closes that,
 * and no copy changed because none of it was false.
 *
 * `request-shape.test.mts` refuses the endpoint by name. A removal rots back
 * in, so it is asserted rather than merely done.
 *
 * Both of those copy lines changed on 27 Sep 2026 (R42), when volume came
 * back for a derived head keyword - `readKeywordVolumes` below. The FAQ now
 * answers "Do you use search volume?" and the confirm footer promises the
 * keyword line the result shows.
