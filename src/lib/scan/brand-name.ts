/**
 * Brand name matching.
 *
 * Engines spell the same brand differently, and the leaderboard is keyed on
 * raw text, so the same company arrives several times and splits its own
 * score. On the first live scan the subject appeared twice - "London Ski Co"
 * at 24 mentions from three engines and "London Ski Co." at 12 from ChatGPT -
 * which understated the client by a third and cost them five places.
 *
 * Worse, the subject was matched with `trim().toLowerCase()`, so the spelling
 * with the full stop was not recognised as the subject at all and was filed as
 * a competitor on the client's own report.
 *
 * brandKey folds the differences that are punctuation and nothing else:
 * case, accents, spacing, ampersands, hyphens, full stops. Everything that
 * survives is a letter or a digit.
 *
 *   "London Ski Co."      -> londonskico
 *   "London Ski Co"       -> londonskico
 *   "NET-A-PORTER"        -> netaporter
 *   "Net-a-Porter"        -> netaporter
 *   "Snow + Rock"         -> snowrock
 *   "Snow+Rock"           -> snowrock
 *   "Sportalm Kitzbühel"  -> sportalmkitzbuhel
 *   "Sportalm Kitzbuhel"  -> sportalmkitzbuhel
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do is merge on prefixes. "Sportalm" stays
 * separate from "Sportalm Kitzbühel", and "Amundsen" from "Amundsen Sports",
 * because the same rule would merge "Snow Peak" into "Snow+Rock" and merge
 * "Moncler Grenoble" - a distinct line - into "Moncler". Under-merging leaves
 * two honest rows; over-merging invents a number nobody can check.

/**
 * One spelling per brand key for a whole scan, preferring one already stored.
 *
 * `pickDisplayName` chooses from the variants in front of it, which is right
 * within a single extraction and not enough across two. The population differs
 * between passes, so the same company can win under one spelling now and
 * another later - and `scan_brands` is unique on (scan_id, engine, brand), so
 * the spelling is part of the conflict target. A second write under a second
 * spelling therefore INSERTS rather than replaces, and the company appears
 * twice on its own leaderboard with its mentions split between the two rows.
 *
 * That is the defect this file's header opens with - "London Ski Co" at 24 and
 * "London Ski Co." at 12, understating the client by a third and costing five
 * places - reappearing one level up, between writes instead of within one.
 *
 * Two routes to it, and they are not equally live. The reachable one today is
 * a re-run: a free pass that fails after the leaderboard is written leaves
 * those rows behind, and the confirm route lets a failed scan be run again by
 * design, so the retry re-extracts freshly read prose and may well land on the
 * other spelling.
 *
 * The second is the gated pass, which extracts over its own engines only and so
 * picks without sight of what the free pass stored. That one is dormant rather
 * than live - `GATED_ENGINES` is empty, so no gated pass runs - but it is armed
 * by an `app_settings` row rather than by a deploy, because `scan_engines_gated`
 * is read from the table and edited by hand in the Supabase editor. Worth
 * closing now rather than when somebody turns the engines back on and the
 * leaderboard quietly starts double-counting.
 *
 * Preferring the stored spelling fixes both at the write, which is what makes
 * it worth doing here rather than merging in each reader: `scan_teaser` groups
 * by the raw text in SQL and `buildUnlockPayload` keys a Map on it, so a fix in
 * one reader would leave the other disagreeing with it. One spelling per key on
 * the way in keeps both correct and needs no migration.
 *
 * Which stored spelling wins, when the table already holds more than one, is
 * settled by `pickDisplayName` over the stored set - so this is stable rather
 * than merely first-seen, and a row set that is already split converges instead
 * of picking a third spelling.

 * Does the answer name the brand?

 *
 * A suffix is only folded where it actually is one - at the end. It used to be
 * stripped wherever it appeared, which quietly turned three kinds of brand
 * into a common noun and then counted that noun as the brand being named:
 * "Inc Magazine" matched any answer containing "magazine", "Company Shop" any
 * answer containing "shop", and "Limited Edition Prints" matched a rival's
 * "edition prints". named_in is the number this product sells and the one in
 * the subject line of the report email, and every one of those errors pushed
 * it the flattering way - telling a buyer an engine named them when it had
 * not. It also mangled a legitimately hyphenated name: "Co-op" became "-op".
 *
 * **A full stop inside the name is kept, and that is the second defect this
 * function has had.** Every full stop used to be replaced by a space before
 * the pattern was built, so "Booking.com" became the two words "booking" and
 * "com" joined by a gap that matches whitespace and hyphens and nothing else -
 * and the name then did not match its own spelling. Not a near miss: an engine
 * writing "Booking.com" exactly as the site spells it was recorded as not
 * having named the brand, on every answer, for every brand with a full stop in
 * it. That is a large class here, because the brand is read off the site and
 * ".com" is a name a company chooses. The damage ran both ways from one
 * boolean: visibility read zero, and `deriveOpportunities` treats "cited for
 * an answer the brand was absent from" as an opportunity, so the placement
 * list filled up with every page on the report.
 *
 * Applied repeatedly, so "Acme Co Ltd" loses both and still reads as "acme",
 * and "Smith & Co., Ltd." loses the trailing stop between each fold.
 * Whitespace is collapsed first, so a name padded or double-spaced by the
 * model reaches the suffix test in the shape the test expects.
