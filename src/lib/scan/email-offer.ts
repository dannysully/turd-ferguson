 * "Do not have time to wait? We will email it to you."
 *
 * Danny, 20 September 2026, item 5, and his own idea. Not a speed fix: **it
 * converts a bounce into a captured address.** Everybody who gives up at ninety
 * seconds is lost silently today.
 *
 * Two decisions live here rather than in `ScanFlow.tsx`, because that file is
 * JSX and nothing can execute it: **when the offer may appear**, and **what it
 * is allowed to promise**. Both are things a visitor reads and acts on, and the
 * second is a claim about our own product that the gate can make false.
 *
 * No `server-only` and no imports beyond the step vocabulary, so `node --test`
 * loads it. Relative and extensionful for the same reason as `run-steps.ts`.

/**
 * The step the offer waits for: the reads.
 *
 * Derived through `STEP_INDEX`, never typed. A literal here is this repo's own
 * named defect species - a fixed rung picked by index against a list that can
 * grow - and it shipped once already in this exact file's caller, where
 * `setProgress(3)` meant "done" until the ladder gained two rungs.
 *
 * The fallback cannot fire: `STEP.reading` is derived from `RUN_STEPS` and
 * `STEP_INDEX` is built from the same array, so the key is always present.
 * `email-offer.test.mts` asserts that rather than trusting it, because a `?? 0`
 * that silently became live would offer to email a report during question
 * generation.

/**
 * How long the reads must have been running before the offer appears.
 *
 * **Danny said "maybe 10 seconds" and the instinct is right while the number is
 * a guess at a distribution nobody has measured.** So it is tied to the run
 * rather than to page load: the clock starts when the engine reads start, which
 * is the phase that actually takes the time, and it cannot fire while the
 * questions are being generated - a scan that is four seconds old has nothing
 * to email and offering reads as an apology for a wait that has not happened.
 *
 * Nine seconds is deliberately under his ten. The offer is only useful before
 * somebody has decided to leave, and by the time a visitor is bored enough to
 * reach for the tab close they are past reading a new panel.
 *
 * **This number is provisional and the way to settle it is now in the tree.**
 * `scans.step_ms` records per-phase elapsed since `71f3b62`, so the reading
 * phase's real distribution is one query away as soon as scans have run -
 * blocked.md 34. Pick it off that rather than arguing about it.

/**

 * **It cannot promise what the gate withholds.** The message links to
 * `/scan/<token>`, which serves the free result and the gate exactly as the
 * screen does - so what arrives is what the visitor is already looking at, and
 * the copy says that and no more. The placement list, the verbatim answers and
 * the gated engines are what an address *unlocks*, and this address is not
 * being traded for them: it buys a copy of a free thing.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole reason these strings are here where a test can
 * read them. The gate's own copy two hundred lines away in `ScanFlow` sells the
 * placement list, correctly, and the two panels can be on screen within a
 * minute of each other. `email-offer.test.mts` asserts this one names none of
 * it, one assertion per word, for the reason recorded at the foot of this file.
