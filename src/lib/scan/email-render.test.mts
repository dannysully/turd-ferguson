/**
 * The first time either transactional email has been rendered.
 *
 * Both messages were shipped, typechecked, built and reviewed without anything
 * ever producing their output. blocked.md carried "could not render either
 * message even once" as an open item across three runs, for want of `node` on
 * the allowlist. It is allowed now, so this is the real thing rather than
 * another regex read back over the source.
 *
 * **The palette used to be hand-copied here, and the comment above it claimed
 * that if the copy and verify-email.ts drifted, `no colour outside the palette`
 * would fail. It could not.** That test rendered with the local copy and then
 * checked the output against the same local copy - true by construction, for
 * any values at all. Nothing in this file read verify-email.ts, so the one
 * thing the duplicate existed to catch was the one thing it could not see. It
 * is this repo's named defect species: a tripwire that passes because it is
 * blind, and the fourth instance found.
 *
 * So the palette is read out of verify-email.ts instead of retyped. It cannot
 * be imported - that module pulls in `server-only`, the Resend SDK and the
 * `@/` alias, none of which load under `node --test`, which is the whole
 * reason email-render.ts exists - so it is parsed from the source, the same
 * way paid-get.test.mts and route-closure.test.mts read theirs.
