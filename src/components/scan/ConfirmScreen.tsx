 *
 * One cluster (BRIEF-3 C1, 30 Sep 2026): the route picks one Google keyword
 * first - measured volume, commercial or transactional intent - and the five
 * prompts are five angles on it. The topic-group chips that used to sit here
 * went with it, and the word "cluster" now means only that keyword and its
 * prompts; the old topic group is `topic` in this file.
 *

 * the set that comes back from the preview is the set stored at confirm, and
 * the pipeline asks what it finds rather than writing its own.

   *
   * On the disable below, because this was the last lint error in the project
   * and it is worth saying why it is not a defect rather than leaving it to be
   * re-litigated every run.
   *
   * react-hooks/set-state-in-effect is aimed at cascading renders: an effect
   * that sets state, causing a render, causing the effect again. That cannot
   * happen here, and it is provable rather than argued. `write` opens with
   * setWriting(true) and setError(""), and on the only path this effect takes:
   *
   * - `writing` is initialised to `p.initialTopic.trim().length >= 2`, which
   *   is the same condition guarding the call. So it is already true.
   * - `error` is initialised to "", which is what it is set to.
   *
   * Both are therefore no-op sets, and React bails out of re-rendering when
   * setState is given the value it already holds. The rule flags it because it
   * cannot see the coupling between the useState initialiser twenty lines up
   * and the guard on this line - and that coupling is deliberate, written to
   * stop the screen saying "tell us the category above" for one frame under a
   * field that already had one.
   *
   * The run-once ref is the other half: the effect re-runs when `write` is
   * rebuilt, and without the guard a second request would fire mid-typing.
   *
   * Restructuring to satisfy the rule - deferring the call into a microtask,
   * say - would add a frame of nothing on the first screen of the funnel to
   * silence a warning about a render that does not occur. Narrowed to this one
   * line so the rule stays live everywhere else.
