/**
 * The result screen, which decides what a visitor is told their scan found.
 *
 * `ResultView.tsx` was 827 lines, the largest of the thirteen source files the
 * census of 20 September 2026 found named by no test - and unlike the other
 * twelve it is not reachable by the four walking sweeps either, because it
 * renders only behind a live scan. Nothing on this machine or in the cloud has
 * ever executed a line of it.
 *
 * What is asserted here is the states a happy scan does not produce: no engine
 * answered, no page was cited, half the pages were sorted, the brand tops its
 * own leaderboard, a question whose tallies and whose rows disagree. Those are
 * the ones that are wrong in production and look fine in a fixture.
 *
 * Nothing here retypes a value out of `result-figures.ts`. Engine keys come
 * from `ENGINES`, labels from `ENGINE_SPECS`, the leaderboard ceiling from
 * `SOV_ROWS` and the plan ceiling from `PLAN_ORDER`, so a changed ceiling
 * moves the expectation with it rather than failing this file.
