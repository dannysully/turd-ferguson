/**
 * The hero, rebuilt from Main.dc.html. Centred - and it is the only centred
 * block on the site, every other page is left-aligned.
 *
 * The domain field is the single call to action. There is no button pair
 * here by design: the scan is the offer, and anything beside it competes
 * with it.
 *
 * The stack is one `.ac-row` group, so it arrives top to bottom at the
 * board's .09s and resolves on the field - the sequence ends on the thing we
 * want used rather than trailing off after it. The two inline pills are
 * `.ac-stamp`, which lands .12s behind the line carrying them because
 * `--ac-i` inherits from the row. Nothing here waits at opacity 0: ac-row
 * holds at .55, so the h1 is painted at first paint and is still the LCP
 * element, and with no JavaScript the whole hero is simply settled.
