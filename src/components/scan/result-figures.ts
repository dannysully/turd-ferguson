/**
 * Every number and every sentence the result screen tells a visitor their scan
 * found, separated from the markup that paints it.
 *
 * `ResultView.tsx` was 827 lines and, on the census of 20 September 2026, one
 * of thirteen source files named by no test. The four walking sweeps read its
 * *rendered* output on the prerendered pages; none of them executes it, and
 * none of them can - the screen renders only behind a live scan. So the file
 * that decides what a visitor is told their scan found had no executor at all,
 * and the queue named it the measurement this repo does not have.
 *
 * Splitting is the same move `brand-name.ts`, `settings-merge.ts`,
 * `dataforseo-request.ts` and `readiness-spec.ts` made, for a different
 * obstacle: there the blocker was `server-only`, here it is JSX, which Node's
 * runner cannot parse however well it strips types. The alternative - a test
 * that retypes the logic beside the component - is how this repo got four
 * blind tripwires, so it is not an alternative.
 *
 * No JSX and no imports beyond two pure modules, so `node --test` loads it.
 * Relative and extensionful for the same reason as `scan-shape.ts`.
 *
 * Nothing here is server-only and nothing here is commercially sensitive: it
 * is what the visitor is already reading, said once instead of in two places.

 *   build. The screen shows no source table at all on this scan, and the
 *   finding copy - "every page the engines cited ..." - is a sentence about
 *   pages that do not exist. Reachable on any scan where every engine failed,
 *   which is the state the headline already has its own branch for.
 * - `unclassified`: pages were cited and none could be sorted.
 * - `partial`: some were sorted and some were not. The ones that were not have
 *   not been ruled out, so "every page ... either already names you, is a
 *   competitor own site, or is somewhere an article cannot run" is not a claim
