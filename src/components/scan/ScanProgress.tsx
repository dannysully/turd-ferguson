 * this is a measurement. Keeping them in one file meant the pitch could not be
 * changed without touching the progress bar, and the progress bar is the one
 * thing on the screen that must not drift.
 *
 * The rule it keeps is the rule it always kept: **the bar is the scan, not the
 * story.** The width comes from the real pipeline step, and the caption under
 * it is that step's own words. Nothing here is driven by whatever the
