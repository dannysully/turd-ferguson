/**
 * The evidence. No board covers this - the five homepage boards scope the
 * product and leave evidence to CaseStudies.dc.html - so it is restyled to
 * the tokens rather than removed. Taking the only proof off a sales page
 * because the design files did not happen to include it would be a
 * commercial change dressed up as a design one.
 *
 * The Vibe Retail figures now carry their windows. The #1 reading has a
 * dated source at last: Danny attested it on 19 Sep 2026 as the account
 * owner, which is what the figure was missing. It is shown as a four-month
 * reading beside the eight-week one rather than replacing it - the campaign
 * produced #4 in eight weeks and the keyword carried on climbing, and
 * collapsing the two would claim #1 in eight weeks, which is not what
 * happened.
 *
 * The "listicle went live in the morning" paragraph has gone, and so has the
 * heading above it, which was "One placement, one morning." An earlier pass
 * removed one of two word-for-word copies of that paragraph and kept the
 * other; this one removes the claim. It said the placement went live in the
 * morning and the AI Overview was citing it as the top source by that
 * evening - a claim about a client's result with no date, no tracker and no
 * name, which is the category AGENTS.md says carries [VERIFY] until there is
 * a dated source. The same sentence was cut from /how-it-works, /what-is-aeo
 * and the blog posts on 19 Sep; it survived here, on /case-studies and on the
 * case study itself, because those sweeps were scoped to the pages with no
 * board. The heading went with it because "one morning" made the same claim
 * in three words.
 *
 * The figures below are untouched - they carry windows and a dated
 * attestation, and they are not what was wrong.
 *
 * The Nomada provenance line is now at the end of the packages board.

/**
 * Each figure carries its own window, because they are readings from
 * different dates and collapsing them would imply the #1 arrived in eight
 * weeks. The eight-week numbers are what the campaign produced; the #1 is a
 * later reading, attested by Danny as the account owner on 19 Sep 2026.
 *
 * Every label below interpolates its figure's own `scope`, so a row cannot be
 * written without the thing that makes its number a reading. That is not
 * tidiness: this panel is where the visibility figure was published as a bare
 * "0% to 25%" with no denominator anywhere on the homepage, while
 * `/case-studies` and the case study both said "of the tracked prompts" and
 * /about published the rule that a percentage without its denominator is not
 * a finding. The denominator was in a comment on this line instead of on the
 * page. See `config/client-results.ts`.
