 * The engines a tier reads, as their own marks (pricing spec, Danny, 27 Sep
 * 2026, section 4): four on alwaystracked, five with Claude on every tier
 * above it. Logos only: the visible "Includes Claude" line went on 28 Sep
 * (Danny, danny.md line 61, R60). No claim that Claude matters more than the
 * others.
 *
 * The list comes from `enginesFor` in pricing.ts, so the staircase, the table
 * and the tier pages cannot disagree about which tier reads what. The marks
 * are decorative to a screen reader; the sr-only sentence carries every name,
 * Claude included where the tier reads it.
